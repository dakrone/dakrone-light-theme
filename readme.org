* Introduction

This theme isn't ready yet :)

If you really want to use it, check it out somewhere and use:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (file-exists-p "/path/to/dakrone-light-theme")
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path
               "/path/to/dakrone-light-theme")
  (load-theme 'dakrone-light t))
#+END_SRC

I'll upload screenshots and all that when its stabilized.
